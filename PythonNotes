Get max/minimum value's index using argmax / argmin()


Converting an date to be the index
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

Set a different column as index for dataframe
df.set_index(columnname)

Working with Timeseries data:
shift is used to shift number of days provided to it as argument.
df.shift(number of days)

timeshift is used to move the first day's data to end of month or end of year using:
df.tshift(freq='M/Y') #M/Y/ is used for moving to end of month or year / quarter.


Rolling average of data can be calculated:
df.rolling(window=number of days).mean() #any function can be used based on requirement
for example std() for standard deviation

plot data with multiple columns
df[[list of column names]].plot()


expanding is used to average/function result of all entries prior to current point
df['Close'].expanding().mean()
